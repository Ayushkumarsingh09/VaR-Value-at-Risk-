# Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation

This project explores the concept of Value at Risk (VaR) and demonstrates its calculation using two methods: the historical method and the Monte Carlo simulation method. VaR is a widely used metric in financial risk management, providing an estimate of the maximum potential loss in value of a portfolio or investment over a specified time period, at a given confidence level.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To understand and calculate VaR using the historical and Monte Carlo simulation methods.
- **Methods:**
  - **Historical Method:** Analyzes historical returns to estimate potential losses.
  - **Monte Carlo Simulation Method:** Uses random simulations based on historical data to predict future returns and estimate potential losses.
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel for practical calculations.
- **Dataset:** Sample dataset of daily stock prices for demonstration purposes.

## Contents

- **Report:** Detailed explanation of VaR, calculation methods, and practical calculations in Excel.
- **Excel File:** Demonstrates VaR calculations using the historical and Monte Carlo simulation methods.

## How to Use

1. Download the Excel file containing the sample dataset and calculations.
2. Open the Excel file to explore VaR calculations using both methods.
3. Refer to the report for a detailed explanation of VaR and the calculation methods.
